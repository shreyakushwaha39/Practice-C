# C Practice Programs

This repository contains C programs that I have written during my personal practice. These programs help me improve my understanding of basic to advanced C programming concepts.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Programs are organized topic-wise:

- conditionals & loops/
- patterns/
- functions/
- recursion/
- arrays/
- strings/
- pointers/

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run any program:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
2. Navigate to the program folder.
3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output

## 🔄 Updates

I will keep adding more programs as I continue practicing C language.
